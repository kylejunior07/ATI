Overview:
This program is a simple currency converter built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to convert currencies from one type to another based on real-time exchange rates fetched from an API.

Prerequisites:
To run this code, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the program relies on the tkinter library, which is usually included in standard Python installations. However, if you don't have it, you can install it using pip:


pip install tk


Furthermore, the program uses the requests library to make HTTP requests to the currency conversion API. You can install it using:


pip install requests


Imports:
The code begins with the necessary import statements:


import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
import requests


API:
The program utilizes the ExchangeRate-API to fetch real-time currency exchange rates. It makes use of the free tier of this API. The API provides a simple endpoint to get exchange rates based on a specified base currency. In this code, we fetch the exchange rates based on the user-selected base currency and use it to perform currency conversion calculations.

Running the Program:
Once you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries, you can run the program by executing the Python script. The GUI window will appear, allowing you to input the amount, select the source currency, select the target currency, and then click the "Convert" button to see the converted amount.

Usage:

Input the amount you want to convert in the "Amount" field.
Select the currency you want to convert from using the dropdown menu labeled "From".
Select the currency you want to convert to using the dropdown menu labeled "To".
Click the "Convert" button.
The converted amount will be displayed in the "Result" field.
Note:

Ensure you have an active internet connection to fetch the latest exchange rates from the API.
The API may have usage limitations or restrictions depending on the tier you are using. Please refer to the ExchangeRate-API documentation for more information.
Additional Information:

This code is a basic implementation and can be further extended with features like error handling, user authentication for accessing premium APIs, and a more polished GUI design.
Remember to handle exceptions appropriately, especially when dealing with network requests and user inputs, to provide a robust user experience.
